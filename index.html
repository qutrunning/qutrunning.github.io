					<h1> About QUT Running </h1>
					<p>
						QUT Running is a social & fitness group, for anyone interested in improving their health, fitness and well-being. We are by no means elite runners, but cater to people at any level from beginner to the very experienced. Being a social club we also host a number of events throughout the year, and give you the opportunity to meet a variety of new people at QUT. We believe everyone can love running. So if you want to start up, pick up where you left off or just keep going this is the perfect group for you. We taylor our sessions to be fun, sociable and welcoming at the same time providing great fitness oportunities.

					<h4>Signing up</h4>
					<p>
						You want to become a member of QUT Running and QUT Running Social? Just show up either on our O-Week stall or on one of our sessions throughout the semester and talk to our Exec Team. We are happy to answer questions and sign you up on the spot. You can even try a running session before you join. IMPORTANT: Please ensure that you come around early enough, so that we have time to talk to you without delaying our session. Within the first few weeks the Exec Team will always be at the Kidney Lawn 30 min prior to the start of the session.

					<h1> QUT Running Social </h1>
					<p>
						QUT Running has a big social aspect. Following our running session on Monday we unwind with dinner and drinks at Beach House in the city. This is a great way to get to know your fellow runners, as it is a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. After dinner we kick on at Music City for karaoke and then onto Down Under. We have a few drinks at both places and enter teams in Bar Wars, which is always massive fun. Every few weeks we spice things up, by booking out a couple of lanes at Strike Bowling and playing laser tag, or having pizza and drinks on the lawn at South Bank.
						<br>
						<br>
						We also attend events hosted by the QUT Guild and co-host events with other clubs, such as QUT Snowriders and Cheer and Dance. These also provide excellent opportunities to meet people from outside QUT Running!
						<br>
						<br>
						Now that you have a bit of a background on the social side of the club, come and join us on Monday evening after our running session! We look forward to seeing you! Join the facebook group for more information.

Meeting point is right in front of the Healthstream entrance next to the food court on Gardens Point Campus. Please be there shortly before 8am, so that you don’t lose too much time getting changed. Using 2 different 50meter swimming lanes, we are providing good exercises and advices for your whole body, depending on your individual level. Full membership is required!
						</p>

						<h3>Running</h3>
						<p>
							This is our most popular running session. Non regard of your running skills, come along to a fun session through the Botanic Garden. Our running coordinator Christoph is providing many different exercises to help you to improve agility, speed, acceleration and endurance. The sessions will usually have the form of an interval session with varying length and amount of the intervals. Furthermore this is a great opportunity to meet other fellow runners, to have a chat and make friends. If you are new to QUT Running, this is the session you should definitely attend. We are happy to answer questions, explain what’s going on or just introduce you to other people. Meeting point for this session is the Kidney Lawn. From there we head to X-Block to store our bags, before we start our run in the Botanic Garden.
