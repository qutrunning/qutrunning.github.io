					<h1> About QUT Running </h1>
					<p>
						QUT Running is a social & fitness group, for anyone interested in improving their health, fitness and well-being. We are by no means elite runners, but cater to people at any level from beginner to the very experienced. Being a social club we also host a number of events throughout the year, and give you the opportunity to meet a variety of new people at QUT. We believe everyone can love running. So if you want to start up, pick up where you left off or just keep going this is the perfect group for you. We taylor our sessions to be fun, sociable and welcoming at the same time providing great fitness oportunities.

					<h1> QUT Running Social </h1>
					<p>
						QUT Running has a big social aspect.Following our running session on Monday we unwind with dinner and drinks at Beach House in the city. This is a great way to get to know your fellow runners, as it is a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. After dinner we kick on at Music City for karaoke and then onto Down Under. We have a few drinks at both places and enter teams in Bar Wars, which is always massive fun. Every few weeks we spice things up, by booking out a couple of lanes at Strike Bowling and playing laser tag, or having pizza and drinks on the lawn at South Bank.
						<br>
						<br>
						We also attend events hosted by the QUT Guild and co-host events with other clubs, such as QUT Snowriders and Cheer and Dance. These also provide excellent opportunities to meet people from outside QUT Running!
						<br>
						<br>
						Now that you have a bit of a background on the social side of the club, come and join us on Monday evening after our running session! We look forward to seeing you! Join the facebook group for more information.

<h3>Swimming</h3>
<p>
Is there any better motivation to start into a new week than to jump into a pool? Of course there isn’t. So come along to our Monday morning swimming session. Meeting point is right in front of the Healthstream entrance next to the food court on Gardens Point Campus. Please be there shortly before 8am, so that you don’t lose too much time getting changed. Using 3 different 50meter swimming lanes, we are providing good exercises and advices for your whole body, depending on your individual level. Full membership is required!
</p>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
This is our most popular running session. Non regard of your running skills, come along to a fun session through the Botanic Garden. Our running coordinator Christoph is providing many different exercises to help you to improve agility, speed, acceleration and endurance. Furthermore this is a great opportunity to meet other fellow runners, to have a chat and make friends. If you are new to QUT Running, this is the session you should definitely attend. We are happy to answer questions, explain what’s going on or just introduce you to other people. Meeting point for this session is the Kidney Lawn. From there we head to X-Block to store our bags, before we start our run in the Botanic Garden.
</p>

<h3>Casual Running</h3>
<p>
You we’re not able to attend the Monday session? Or you need some extra workouts to stay fit? No worries! This casual running session is suitable for everybody. We’ll take it easier today after our Monday night with QUT Running Social! Starting at 5 pm from Kidney Lawn, we head of to either the Botanic Garden or to a nice paced track along the river.
</p>

<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2 color-orange">

Healthstream is providing the opportunity for us to use their gym facilities (including changing room and showers) on Wednesdays from 3pm to 4pm. Meeting point is right in front of the Healthstream entrance next to the food court on Gardens Point Campus. Please be there shortly before 3pm, so that you don’t lose too much time getting changed. During the gym session you are your own boss, we won’t tell you what to do. Create your own workout or take some advices from our experienced gym coordinator Håvard. Full membership is required!
</p>

<h3>Intermediate and Expert Running</h3>
<p>
Attention! For experienced runners only! If you’re unsure about being experienced enough…are you able to cover 10km in less than 55min? If the answer is yes, come along! We are trying to push you even harder. A mixture of endurance, mountain, speed or interval sessions is waiting for you. Meeting at Kidney Lawn at 5 pm, we head off to several different tracks throughout Brisbane. You are guided by our session coordinator Christoph and our bootcamp/swimming coordinator Håvard.
</p>

<h3>Beginner Running</h3>
<p>
Our Beginner session on Thursdays at 5pm is for all those who recently started to run. All exercises are designed for beginners! We help you to get into this sport and to motivate you to run more often. We won’t cover a long distance or a high speed. Meeting point is the Kidney Lawn.
</p>

<h3>Bootcamp</h3>
<p>
Bootcamp is an excellent opportunity to work on your stamina and strength/stability at the same time. Our president (!) Drew is combining running and strength exercises for you in order to get your body fit for the beach! Every fitness level is welcome. Meeting point is the Kidney Lawn.
