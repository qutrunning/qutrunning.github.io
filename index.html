						Do you want to become a member of QUT Running and QUT Running Social? Just show up either at our O-Week stall or at one of our sessions throughout the semester and talk to a member of our Exec Team. We are happy to answer any and all questions and sign you up on the spot. You can even try a running session before you join, free of charge. IMPORTANT: Please ensure that you come around early enough, so that we have time to talk to you without delaying our session. Within the first few weeks the Exec Team will always be at the Kidney Lawn 30 min prior to the start of the session.

					<h1> QUT Running Social </h1>
					<br>
					<p id="get-started">
						QUT Running has a big social aspect. Following our running session on Monday we unwind with dinner and drinks at Beach House in the city. This is a great way to get to know your fellow runners, as it is a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. After dinner we usually kick on at Music City for karaoke and then head to the Down Under bar. We have a few drinks at both places and enter teams in Bar Wars, which is always massive fun. Every few weeks we spice things up, by booking out a couple of lanes at Strike Bowling and playing laser tag, or having pizza and drinks on the lawn at South Bank.
						<br>
						<br>
						We also attend events hosted by the QUT Guild and co-host events with other clubs, such as QUT Snowriders and QUT Cheer and Dance. These provide excellent opportunities to meet people from outside QUT Running in an a relaxed environment!
						<br>
						<br>
						Now that you have a bit of a background on the social side of the club, come and join us on Monday evening after our running session! We look forward to seeing you! Don't forget to join the Facebook group for more information.

					<h3>Swimming (FM)</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Is there any better motivation to start into a new week than to jump into a pool? Of course there isn’t! So come along to our Monday morning swimming session. The meeting point is right in front of the Healthstream entrance next to the food court at P Block on Gardens Point Campus. Please be there shortly before 8am so that you don’t lose too much time getting changed. Using 2 different 50m olympic-length swimming lanes, we provide good exercises and advice for your entire body, catered to your individual skill level. Full membership is required!
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Running</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						This is our most popular running session. Regardless of your running skills, come along to a fun session where we run through the relaxing Botanic Gardens. Our running coordinator Eamon is able to demonstrate and coordinate many different exercises to help you to improve your agility, speed, acceleration, and endurance. The sessions are usually in the form of an interval session with varying length and amounts of the intervals. Furthermore, this is a great opportunity to meet other fellow runners, to have a chat or to just make friends. If you are new to QUT Running, this is the session you should definitely attend. We are happy to answer questions, explain what’s going on or even introduce you to other people. Meeting point for this session is the Kidney Lawn. From there we head to X block to store our bags before our run.
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Casual Running</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Not able to attend our Monday sesh? Hungover? No worries! This casual running session is suitable for everybody. In this particular session, we take it easier today than our Monday afternoon runs, and start at 8:30am from Kidney Lawn on Fridays. It is then held at either within the Botanic Gardens or around and along the river.
					</p>						
					<br>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">

					<h3>Gym (FM)</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Healthstream has provided us with the opportunity for us to use their gym facilities (including changing room and showers) on Wednesdays from 3pm to 4pm. Meeting point is right in front of the Healthstream entrance next to the food court at P block on Gardens Point Campus. Please be there shortly before 3pm, so that you don’t lose too much time getting changed. During the gym session you are your own boss, we won’t tell you what to do. Create your own workout or take some advice from our experienced gym coordinator Joe. Full membership is required!
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>
<!-- 
					<h3>Intermediate and Expert Running</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						**Attention!** For experienced runners only! If you’re unsure as to whether or not you are experienced enough: are you able to cover 10km in less than 55min? If yes,this session is for you! Here we try to push you even harder than any of our normal running sessions. A mixture of endurance, mountain, speed or interval intense exercises await you. We meet at Kidney Lawn at 5pm and then head off to several different tracks throughout Brisbane. You are guided by the experienced runner Eamon Burke.
					</p>
					<br>
					<br> -->

					<h3>Beginner Running</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Our Beginner session on Thursdays at 4pm is for all those who have recently started to run or are coming back from a longer break. All exercises are designed for beginners! We help you to get into running as a sport or hobby and assist in motivating you to run more often. We won’t cover a long distance or a high speed. Meeting point is the Kidney Lawn.
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3>Bootcamp</h3>
					<br>
					<p id="map">
						Bootcamp is an excellent opportunity to hone your stamina and strength/stability at the same time. Our bootcamp coordinator Joe combines running and body-weight exercises for you so that you can get that perfect beach body! Every fitness level is welcome. Meeting point is the Kidney Lawn.

								Brisbane is the perfect place to party, with its superb weather, bars, clubs and pubs, and the Base Backpackers Brisbane Central youth hostel is located in the centre of all the action!
								<br><br>
								Base Backpackers Brisbane Central has everything a backpacker could want, with our five floors offering a wide variety of rooms to appeal to everyone from the newly-arrived to the newly-wed, including dormitory and private rooms. All rooms are secured via electronic keycards, while you can keep your valuables doubly secured with our supplied lockers. Linen is also provided so there's no need to bring your sleeping bag!
								<br><br>
								Downstairs the Down Under Bar is where you can go full on, flat out! Come on down to Brisbane's most famous backpacker bar where you can win great prizes, dance the night away: or even meet Mr/Mrs Right (or Mr/Mrs Right Now…). If you're after something a little quieter then our Zi Bar does great food and coffee, with regular functions to keep you entertained.
