						<h1>Session Information</h1>
						<br>
						<p>FM = Full Membership required
						<br>
						<br>
						<h3>Swimming (FM)</h3>
						<p>
							Is there any better motivation to start into a new week than to jump into a pool? Of course there isn’t! So come along to our Monday morning swimming session. The meeting point is right in front of the Healthstream entrance next to the food court at P Block on Gardens Point Campus. Please be there shortly before 8am so that you don’t lose too much time getting changed. Using 2 different 50m olympic-length swimming lanes, we provide good exercises and advice for your entire body, catered to your individual skill level. Full membership is required!
						</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Running</h3>
						<p>
							This is our most popular running session. Regardless of your running skills, come along to a fun session where we run through the relaxing Botanic Gardens. Our running coordinator Eamon is able to demonstrate and coordinate many different exercises to help you to improve your agility, speed, acceleration, and endurance. The sessions are usually in the form of an interval session with varying length and amounts of the intervals. Furthermore, this is a great opportunity to meet other fellow runners, to have a chat or to just make friends. If you are new to QUT Running, this is the session you should definitely attend. We are happy to answer questions, explain what’s going on or even introduce you to other people. Meeting point for this session is the Kidney Lawn. From there we head to X block to store our bags before our run.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Casual Running</h3>
						<p>
							Not able to attend our Monday sesh? Hungover? No worries! This casual running session is suitable for everybody. In this particular session, we take it easier today than our Monday afternoon runs, and start at 8:30am from Kidney Lawn on Fridays. It is then held at either within the Botanic Gardens or around and along the river.
						</p>						
						<br>
						<h3>Gym (FM)</h3>
						<p>
							Healthstream has provided us with the opportunity for us to use their gym facilities (including changing room and showers) on Wednesdays from 3pm to 4pm. Meeting point is right in front of the Healthstream entrance next to the food court at P block on Gardens Point Campus. Please be there shortly before 3pm, so that you don’t lose too much time getting changed. During the gym session you are your own boss, we won’t tell you what to do. Create your own workout or take some advice from our experienced gym coordinator Joe. Full membership is required!
						</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Beginner Running</h3>
						<p>
							Our Beginner session on Thursdays at 4pm is for all those who have recently started to run or are coming back from a longer break. All exercises are designed for beginners! We help you to get into running as a sport or hobby and assist in motivating you to run more often. We won’t cover a long distance or a high speed. Meeting point is the Kidney Lawn.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Bootcamp</h3>
						<p>
							Bootcamp is an excellent opportunity to hone your stamina and strength/stability at the same time. Our bootcamp coordinator Joe combines running and body-weight exercises for you so that you can get that perfect beach body! Every fitness level is welcome. Meeting point is the Kidney Lawn.
